## Description :clipboard:
<p>
This project is about handling pipes.

Optimized data sorting algorithm. The goal of this project is to sort in ascending order a stack with X amount of random different integers using a limited set of movement operations with the lowest possible count of movements.

For more information about the project check the [subject here](https://github.com/pedromessetti/pipex/blob/master/subject.pdf). The library and functions were written following the rules described in the 42 Norme. To check the Norme [click here](https://github.com/42School/norminette/blob/master/pdf/en.norm.pdf).

## Operation :wrench:

<p>
The subject says that Im only allowed to use 2 stacks named A and B. At the beginning stack A has all the unsorted numbers and stack B is empty. Wen running the program displays on the standard output the smallest program, made of Push Swap language instructions, that sorts the integers received as arguments. At the end the stack A is sorted in ascending order and stack B is empty. For sorting we are allowed to use only the following moves:
